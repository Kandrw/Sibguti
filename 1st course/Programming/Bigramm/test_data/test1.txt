at the beginning of the century, the german abbot johann trisemus proposed encrypting two letters at a time. 
ciphers using a similar principle were called bigram ciphers. 
usually such ciphers use tables similar to the polybius square, filled with the characters of the alphabet used. 
the most famous bigram cipher is called playfair. 
it was used by great britain in the first world war. 
the plaintext was divided into pairs of letters and the encryption text was constructed from it according to the following three very simple rules.
